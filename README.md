# Enhancing Bone Fracture Detection: Implementing Transfer Learning and Adversarial Training

## Description
Enhancing Bone Fracture Detection: Implementing Transfer Learning and Adversarial Training is a Python-based computer vision project design to improve the accuracy and robustness of bone fracture detection by leveraging pre-trained deep learning models and adversarial training techniques to enhance model generalization.
## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher â†’ [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- The required dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Install all the required libraries 
Prepare your dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.
Run the main Python script to start the bone fracture detection process.
The model will process the images and generate predictions.
